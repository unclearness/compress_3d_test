## Draco compression test
Samples to pass geometry data to draco on memory.

The official draco repository provides CLI tools to exchange obj/ply and drc (`draco_encoder` and `draco_decoder` at https://github.com/google/draco/tree/main/src/draco/tools), but it does not give samples to pass data on memory.
